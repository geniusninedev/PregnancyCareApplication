<p class="auto-style6"><strong>Introduction to Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style1">This document provides an 
overview of pregnancy; the reproductive process through which a new baby is 
conceived, incubated and ultimately born into the world. Many facets of 
pregnancy are covered starting with the preparation and planning stages, and 
moving through conception, fetal development, labor and delivery, and 
post-partum (or post-birth) stages. The document describes normal, uncomplicated 
pregnancy in some detail, and also contains information concerning more 
difficult pregnancies, including pregnancies for women with chronic illnesses 
and other health complications.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">pregnant womanPregnancy is a unique, exciting and 
often joyous time in a woman's life, as it highlights the woman's amazing 
creative and nurturing powers while providing a bridge to the future. Pregnancy 
comes with some cost, however, for a pregnant woman needs also to be a 
responsible woman so as to best support the health of her future child. The 
growing fetus (the term used to denote the baby-to-be prior to birth) depends 
entirely on its mother's healthy body for all needs. Consequently, pregnant 
women must take steps to remain as healthy and well-nourished as they possibly 
can. Pregnant women should take into account the many health care and lifestyle 
considerations described in this center.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Though we have tried to present relatively 
comprehensive coverage of pregnancy, this document should only be considered to 
be an overview. It will hopefully introduce you to some new ideas, and help you 
to learn about aspects of pregnancy that you may not have previously 
encountered, but it does not contain or provide all the information you will 
need to make informed choices as you go through your own actual pregnancy. Be 
sure to see your doctor when you become pregnant. Share with him or her any 
questions or concerns you may have about your pregnancy. Your doctor, and other 
specialized health care providers including nurses and midwives, will be some of 
your more important allies during your pregnancy. They are in the best position 
to guide you through the process and to make authoritative recommendations that 
will best benefit your baby-to-be's development and future health and welfare.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><strong>The Basics of Conception</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
<img alt="male and female symbols" class="auto-style1" src="one.JPG" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">A pregnancy occurs when 
reproductive cells from a man and a woman's body become combined inside a 
woman's uterus. The normal way that this occurs is through sexual intercourse, 
where the man's penis enters the woman's vagina and ejaculates sperm (the male 
reproductive cells) into the vagina during the process of orgasm or sexual 
climax. Microscopic though they are, the sperm are able to move around within 
the vagina, and make their way through the cervix and into the uterus where, if 
the timing is just right, a female ovum or egg (the female reproductive cell) is 
waiting. Sexually mature adult females ovulate (produce eggs) once each month as 
a part of their normal menstrual cycle. The sperm compete to penetrate the outer 
membrane or covering of the egg which seals off permanently once a single sperm 
makes its way inside. The new sperm and egg combination next exchange genetic 
material to form a unique blueprint for a new human being, producing a 
fertilized egg that will later attach itself to the wall of the uterus and start 
growing into a new human being if all goes well. Conception is said to occur at 
the moment the egg and sperm combine.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">male and female symbolsThough intercourse is the 
normal method through which an egg and a sperm get together, modern reproductive 
medicine has opened up new possibilities. Today, eggs can be directly removed 
from a woman's ovaries, and combined with sperm outside of the uterus through a 
process called in vitro fertilization. The fertilized egg is then put back into 
the woman's body so that a normal pregnancy may take place. In vitro 
fertilization is outside the scope of this document, please see our document 
covering Infertility for further information on this and related infertility 
topics.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><strong>Planning Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
<img alt="woman deep in thought" class="auto-style1" src="two.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">Despite the incredible 
fertility of some women, most women find that it takes a little effort to get 
pregnant. It is not enough to simply have intercourse. The timing of that 
intercourse must be just right so that sperm and egg get to meet. There must be 
no significant obstacles that would prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. The 
sperm and egg must be must both be of good-enough quality. If any of these or 
other important events do not occur, pregnancy will not occur. Considering the 
list of problems that can cause a pregnancy to fail, it is in some ways amazing 
that so many pregnancies do occur.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">woman deep in thoughtHaving made the decision to 
become pregnant, there are a few things you can do to increase your likelihood 
of conceiving. In this next section, we discuss several methods for predicting 
the best time of the month to try to become pregnant, including natural planning 
and over-the-counter options.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Counting Days. Timing is an important consideration 
for women who want to become pregnant through regular sexual intercourse. A 
woman is most likely to become pregnant during ovulation, which is the time when 
her egg is released from one of her two ovaries. Women with 28-day menstrual 
cycles (where 28 days occur between the start of one period and the start of the 
next period) will be most fertile between 13 and 15 days after the start of 
their last period. Not all women have 28-day period cycles, however. You can 
reliably estimate when you will ovulate by subtracting 14 days from the length 
of your personal cycle. For example, if you have a 30 day cycle, you would 
subtract 14 from 30 to arrive at 16, meaning that you are most likely to be 
fertile about 16 days after the start of your last period.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Sperm only stay active for several days once they are 
inside a woman's body. Therefore, it is a good idea to have sexual intercourse 
no less than every other day during the middle third of your menstrual cycle, if 
you want to maximize your chances of getting pregnant. For example, if you have 
a 28-day cycle, you should plan to have sex every other day from day 9. If you 
have a 30-day cycle, you should start having every-other-day sex starting on day 
10. Timing sexual intercourse to occur during ovulation can increase your 
likelihood of pregnancy (assuming your calculations are correct).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Cervical Mucous Monitoring. The cervical mucous is a 
lubricating fluid that coats the cervix, which is the opening between the vagina 
and the uterus. This mucous plays a special role in assisting pregnancy. During 
ovulation, it forms a "corridor" or pathway through which sperm can travel 
en-route to the uterus. The cervical mucous also supplies sperm with nutrients 
that help them survive for up to five days within the woman's body.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You can predict when ovulation will occur by examining 
and recording the consistency of your cervical mucous as it changes throughout 
your menstrual cycle.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">In order to retrieve some cervical mucous for 
examination, insert one (clean) finger into your vagina, circle it around your 
cervix and vagina, then hook your finger so as to gather the mucous. Next, place 
the retrieved mucous between two fingers (usually the thumb and index finger), 
and stretch the fingers apart so that you can see whether the mucous breaks 
apart or stretches. Before and after ovulation the cervical mucous is cloudy and 
breaks apart easily. However, during ovulation the cervical mucous usually 
becomes clear, slippery and stretchable. It will often stretch an inch or more 
before breaking apart. The consistency of cervical mucous during ovulation has 
been likened to that of raw egg white.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">In order to maximize your chances of conceiving, you 
should time sexual intercourse to occur when your cervical mucous is clear, 
slippery, and stretchable. Be aware, however, that other factors besides 
ovulation can influence the consistency of the cervical mucous, including your 
age, any medications you might be taking, and whether or not you might have an 
infection. If you choose to use this method, it is important that you monitor 
yourself frequently throughout the month so that changes will be most obvious 
when they occur.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Monitoring. A variety of 
hormones (chemicals occurring naturally in the body that act like switches to 
turn things on or off) regulate the various parts of a woman's normal menstrual 
cycle. The hormones released during ovulation cause women's body temperature to 
rise. Careful daily measurement of a woman's basal body temperature (abbreviated 
as BBT; basal means "resting" or "baseline") can thus indicate when she is about 
to ovulate.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">To monitor your basal body temperature, begin taking 
your temperature on the first day of your period, before you get out of bed in 
the morning. You should take this measurement before getting out of bed, because 
once you do get out of bed, that activity may cause your body temperature to 
rise. For best results, use a mercury thermometer or a thermometer specifically 
labeled for recording basal body temperature. Modern electronic thermometers are 
generally not sensitive enough to detect the slight changes in temperature that 
occur during ovulation. Continue taking your temperature each day for 2 to 3 
months, recording your temperature on a chart or graph each morning so that you 
develop a record of your BBT.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">As you examine your temperature measurements across 
several different menstrual cycles, you will likely see a pattern emerge. Your 
temperature is likely to dip down just before ovulation occurs and then rise by 
about 1 to 1 1/2 degrees (F) after ovulation occurs. In most women, this slight 
rise in temperature generally will continue until several days before the next 
period is due, at which point it drops down again. For best results you should 
time sexual intercourse to correspond with the rise in your basal body 
temperature.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">By itself, basal body temperature monitoring helps you 
to know the length of your cycles, and helps you predict when ovulation is 
likely to happen. When combined with ovulation predictor kits (discussed below) 
and other methods, BBT becomes an effective tool for helping you to know the 
best times to conceive.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Ovulation Predictor Kits. Although natural (day, 
temperature) monitoring methods work well enough to suit the needs of many 
women, some women like the convenience and additional accuracy offered by 
over-the-counter ovulation predictor kits (or OPKs). These kits are actually 
small prepackaged chemical detector tests which are sensitive to changes in 
Luteinizing hormone found in a woman’s urine. Rising levels of Luteinizing 
hormone generally indicate that ovulation will occur within the next 24 to 48 
hours. Hence, every-other-day sexual intercourse should be timed to start when a 
positive OPK test result has been obtained.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">OPKs are most useful for women who have regular 
menstrual cycles of 25 to 35 days duration. Your best bet is to combine the use 
of OPKs with the other methods of detecting ovulation, such as day counting or 
basal temperature monitoring so that you will have a good idea of what time of 
the month you should start testing your urine. OPKs are a good way to detect 
ovulation before it happens, while methods like BBT tell you that ovulation has 
already occurred.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">A Note about Birth Control Pills. If you were using 
birth control pills prior to trying to become pregnant, it may take you several 
months before your fertility levels return to normal. In recognition of this 
fact, doctors typically recommend that women stop using birth control pills two 
to three months prior to when they hope to become pregnant. Irregular period 
durations are also normal while your body is readjusting to life without birth 
control. Every woman's experience is different. It may take you longer than 
three months to become pregnant, or you may become pregnant the first month 
after you stop taking the pill.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><strong>Preparing your Body for Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
<img alt="pills spilling from bottle" class="auto-style1" src="three.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">Your lifestyle can affect the 
health of your future baby, even prior to conception. Because your developing 
baby will entirely depend on your body for nourishment and protection, it is 
wise to alter your lifestyle prior to conception so that you eliminate any bad 
habits or risk factors that might compromise your health.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Avoid Toxins. Many parts of your daily routine that 
you engage in without a second thought can be quite harmful to your developing 
baby. You will endanger your developing fetus, for instance, if you smoke, or 
drink alcohol, or use certain drugs, including certain prescription medications 
your doctor may have recommended! Although you may take it for granted that 
these these are safe in moderation, they have a much more powerful and negative 
effect on a developing fetus than they do on a full-grown adult. In addition to 
stopping smoking, drinking alcohol, and using any recreational drugs prior to 
getting pregnant, you should also meet with your doctor to review all the 
prescription medications you are currently taking to determine whether they are 
safe for you to continue to use during pregnancy. The topic of what to avoid 
while pregnant is covered in greater detail below in the section titled 
"Universal Precautions".</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">pills spilling from bottlePrenatal Vitamins. Your baby 
requires vitamins and minerals in order to develop properly. Various serious 
birth defects can occur if you allow yourself to develop a vitamin deficiency 
while pregnant. For this reason, doctors recommend that pregnant women take a 
prenatal vitamin supplement. You may want to consider taking prenatal vitamins 
even before you become pregnant so as to prepare your body for the demands of 
pregnancy.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">One important advantage to taking prenatal supplements 
before you become pregnant is the inclusion of folic acid in these supplements. 
It is particularly important that your body have enough folic acid on board 
during the early part of your pregnancy because folic acid prevents a very 
serious developmental complication called a neural tube defect from occurring. 
Pregnant women and those women hoping to become pregnant soon should take 
between 800 and 1,000 micrograms of folic acid each day.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><strong>Identifying Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
<img alt="list with boxes checked" class="auto-style1" src="four.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">If you are anxiously awaiting 
confirmation that you are indeed pregnant, any small change in the way you feel 
might find you running out to buy a home pregnancy test. Before you get carried 
away, take some time to investigate your symptoms and make sure they aren’t 
indicators of a different kind.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">list with boxes checkedFor most women, the first signs 
of pregnancy are a missed period, breast fullness, breast tenderness, nausea, 
frequent headaches, and fatigue. While some symptoms of pregnancy can occur as 
soon as one week after conception, the same symptoms can also indicate other 
non-pregnancy related conditions. For example, some women experience breast 
tenderness right before their menstrual period. Even if you experience several 
symptoms characteristic of pregnancy, this doesn't mean that you are necessarily 
pregnant. You may find, for instance, that your nausea, fatigue, and frequent 
headaches are signs of the flu, rather than pregnancy. There is a difference 
between a pregnancy symptom (which may indicate pregnancy, but might also 
indicate illness or infection) and the more definitive pregnancy sign (such as a 
positive blood test for pregnancy or a detectable fetal heartbeat).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Once you have determined that your symptoms are not 
caused by illness, you may want to use a home pregnancy test to confirm that you 
are pregnant. Home pregnancy tests measure the amount of a hormone called human 
chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the urine. HCG levels are low in women who are 
not pregnant, and begin to increase within the first few weeks of conception. 
Although most tests claim to be able to detect pregnancy as soon as the first 
day of your missed period, you will obtain a more accurate result by waiting to 
take the test until 7 days after the day you expected your period to occur.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Although home pregnancy test results are generally 
accurate, they aren't as definitive as the blood test for pregnancy that your 
doctor can administer. Home pregnancy tests can sometimes produce false negative 
and false positive results. Blood tests remain the most effective method of 
detecting pregnancy. You should ask your doctor to perform a blood test a week 
after your missed period if you suspect you may be pregnant despite a negative 
home pregnancy test result, or if you want positive confirmation as to whether 
you are pregnant or not.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><strong>Due Dates and Prenatal Care</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
<img alt="calendar with date circled" class="auto-style1" src="five.jpg" /></p>
<p class="auto-style5"><span class="auto-style1">One of the first questions a 
pregnant woman hears is "when are you due?" (meaning "when are you expected to 
give birth?"). Because every woman is different and because it is often 
difficult to determine the actual date on which conception occurred, a due date 
is often an educated estimate.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">calendar with date circledDoctors have several methods 
for calculating your due date. The popular "Naegle's Rule" estimate is 
calculated by counting back three months from the first day of your last period, 
and then adding seven days. Many web sites offer calculators that automate the 
process of predicting your due date, based on the date of your last menstrual 
period. Keep in mind that while a normal pregnancy usually lasts between 38 and 
42 weeks, these calculators are often set up to predict a pregnancy of 40 weeks 
(or the average between these expected extremes). Your own actual due date will 
happen when it happens, despite the best efforts of calculators everywhere.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><strong>Prenatal Care</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Prenatal care (medical care delivered before you give 
birth) is important for the health of both mother and baby. This medical care 
can begin before you are actually pregnant. However, it really must begin as 
soon as you know you are pregnant in order to help insure that you have a 
healthy pregnancy. During your first prenatal care visit, your doctor will 
gather information about your disease history, personal habits (alcohol and drug 
use, exercise habits, the type of work that you do, etc.), family history (of 
multiple births, diseases, complicated pregnancy in close relatives, etc.), and 
any previous pregnancies, miscarriages, and/or abortions you may have had. It is 
also important that you share any complications that you may have experienced 
during previous pregnancies. As part of the initial exam, your doctor may 
perform an ultrasound test, and or blood tests. A pelvic exam is also sometimes 
performed.</span></p>
